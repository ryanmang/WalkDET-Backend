Christian W. Brandt, who designed a number of smaller Detroit houses like the Times Square Theater and LaSalle Garden Theater. Between 1930 and 1949, it was 
remodeled several times, and continued to operate until closing in 1958. In 1963, the former theater was acquired by the Detroit Theater Organ Society, who renovated it 
and reduced seating from 1,200 to about 900. They relocated the Mighty Wurlitzer organ (formerly the Fisher Theater organ) from the Iris Theater, where it was briefly 
kept in 1961-2, to the Senate Theater. Since then, the Senate Theater has been home to the DTOS, and features organ concerts. In December 2009 the theater closed

orange bricks -- a specially formulated shade dubbed Guardian brick by the architect. 

The interior contains rare black marble, as well as numidian marble (chosen for it''s unusual blood-red color. 
No mines in the world quarried it at the time, so the architect (Rowland) went to Africa, where a mine that had been closed for 30 years 
was reopened just long enough for him to pick out the marble he needed for the lobby. In 1998, Smith, Hinchman & Grylls - 
now known simply as the SmithGroup - moved into the Guardian, the gem that one of its architects had designed 70 years earlier.
The Guardian was designated a National Historic Landmark in June 1989.',

station remained open for business until the cessation of Amtrak service on January 6, 1988. Since 2011, demolition works, 
minor structural repairs, repairs of the roof structure, and covering the glass roof openings in the concourse have been 
performed. The basement, which was once full of water, has been fully drained. Barbed wire fencing has been installed in 
an attempt to keep out vandals and the windows in the tower have been replaced. Restoration projects and plans had gone as
far as the negotiation process, but none had come to fruition until May 2018 when Ford Motor Company purchased the building 
for redevelopment into a mixed use facility and cornerstone of the company''s new Corktown campus.',
